## What is this

Counts of (groups of OSM tags/keys, specific tags, or specific keys) which are selected and currated by me.

## How to use

These are raw counts. To make them useful you'll likey want to do population-weighted statistics. Here is one way to do so:

### Using exactextract

https://github.com/isciences/exactextract

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/master/geojson/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.geojson
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chapmanjacobd/rasters/main/osm/drinking_water_yes.tif.gzip
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chapmanjacobd/rasters/main/pop.tif
gzip -d ./drinking_water_yes.tif.gzip

# NAME, ISO_A2, ECONOMY
exactextract -r pop:pop.tif \
  -r variable:drinking_water_yes.tif \
  -p ne_10m_admin_0_countries.geojson \
  -f NAME \
  -s "sum(pop)" \
  -s "min(variable)" \
  -s "max(variable)" \
  -s "pop_weighted_mean=weighted_mean(variable,pop)" \
  -o countries-drinking_water.geojson
```

Included Population (pop.tif) is WorldPop 2020
