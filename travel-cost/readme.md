# Travel cost rasters

- Time
- Monetary

I'm not sure how useful these are. Each pixel represents the cost to travel over that pixel--more likely starting outside that pixel and ending outside of it.

I think maybe the Thailand pixels or maybe it is Vietnam/Myanmar which are in their native currency so those values might need to be divided by 30 or something. I'm not really sure...
